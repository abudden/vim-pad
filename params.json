It works great along other plugins like\r\n[VimOutliner](https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner/) and\r\n[quicktask](https://github.com/aaronbieber/quicktask).\r\n\r\n![screen 1](http://i.minus.com/idY6u5JQmWPxv.png)\r\n![screen 2](http://i.minus.com/iDIssgARMkBex.png)\r\n![screen 3](http://i.minus.com/i2PXru1c0N5bW.png)\r\n\r\n## Branches\r\n\r\n* `master` contains the released version of the plugin.\r\n\r\n* `devel` contains the development version of the plugin. \r\n\r\nPull requests are to be done over `devel`. When submitting a bug, please tag\r\nthe affected versions.\r\n\r\n## Configuration and Usage\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT**: you must set the g:pad_dir variable to a valid path.
